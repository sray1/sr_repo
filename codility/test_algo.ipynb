    "# Chapter 5: prefix sums\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simple yet powerful technique that allows for the fast calculation of sums of elements in given slice (contiguous segments of array). Its main idea uses prefix sums which are defined as the consecutive totals of the first 0,1,2,...,n elements of an array. We can easily calculate the prefix sums in O(n) time complexity. Notice that the total p[k] equals p[k−1] + a[k−1],  so each consecutive value can be calculated in a constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can calculate suffix sums, which are the totals of the k last values. Using prefix (or suffix) sums allows us to calculate the total of any slice of the array very quickly. For example, assume that you are asked about the totals of m slices [x..y] such that 0 ‹ x ‹ y < n, where the total is the sum a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[y−1] + a[y]. The simplest approach is to iterate through the whole array for each result separately; however, that requires O(n·m) time. The better approach is to use prefix sums. If we calculate the prefix sums then we can answer each question directly in constant time."
